                <p>Hi, my name is Gabriella and I'm an Inequalities and Social Science graduate from the London School of Economics. I've always been interested in social change and have volunteered at several charities and enterprises. The last couple of years I've been exposed to the benefits of succesfull social entrepreneurship, which made me really interested in the idea of business to do good.</p>

                <h2>The project</h2>
                <div id="project">
                    <h4>Interested in social entrepreneurship?</h4>
                    <p>We're all interested in social entrepreneurship and realized that although there are loads of resources and funding opportunities for social entrepreneurs, there's not one place where they are easily findable. So with this project we're trying to bring all resources together to ensure setting up your own business becomes a bit easier. Hopefully it helps you make the world a better place!</p>
